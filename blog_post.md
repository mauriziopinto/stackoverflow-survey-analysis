# Do Developers Fear AI? What 54,000 Programmers Told Us

*An analysis of the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey reveals surprising insights about AI, salaries, and job satisfaction in tech.*

With AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot reshaping how we write code, one question keeps coming up: **Are developers worried about losing their jobs to AI?**

I analyzed responses from nearly 54,000 developers worldwide in the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to find out. Here's what the data reveals.

## The Big Question: Is AI Coming for Developer Jobs?

**Short answer: Most developers aren't worried.**

Only **13% of developers** said they see AI as a threat to their current job. The vast majority (87%) either said "No" or remain uncertain.

What's particularly interesting is *who* feels threatened. Using machine learning, I found that developers who **use AI tools daily are actually less likely** to see AI as a threat. It seems that hands-on experience with AI builds confidence rather than fear.

## Show Me the Money: What Do Developers Earn?

For US-based developers, the numbers are impressive:

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Median Salary | **$140,000** |
| Average Salary | $147,000 |
| Top 25% Earn | $190,000+ |

Education matters, but perhaps not as much as you'd think. While advanced degrees correlate with higher pay, many successful developers hold only bachelor's degrees or are self-taught.

## Does Remote Work Make Developers Happier?

Here's a surprise: **not really**.

Job satisfaction scores hover around 6.5-7.0 out of 10 regardless of whether developers work remotely, in-office, or hybrid. The data suggests that *where* you work matters less than *what* you work on and *who* you work with.

## The AI Adoption Wave

The most striking finding? **AI tools have gone mainstream.** The majority of developers now use AI assistants, with daily users being the largest group.

This isn't just young developers jumping on trends—AI adoption is remarkably consistent across all age groups, from fresh graduates to seasoned veterans.

## What This Means for You

If you're a developer worried about AI, the data offers reassurance: those who embrace these tools tend to feel more secure, not less. If you're considering a tech career, salaries remain strong, and flexibility in work arrangements is now standard.

The future of development isn't humans versus AI—it's humans *with* AI.
